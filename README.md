# OpenPrintTag Material Database

An open-source, community-driven database of 3D printing materials, brands, and packaging specifications. Part of the [OpenPrintTag](https://openprinttag.org) initiative.

## What is this?

This repository is a **publicly editable database** of 3D printing materials stored in human-readable YAML files. Think of it as a community wiki for filament specifications, but in a format that machines can also understand.

**What's inside:**
- **101 brands** — Material manufacturers from Prusament to Hatchbox
- **10,326 materials** — PLA, PETG, ASA, TPU and many more with detailed properties
- **750 packages** — Physical products with GTINs/barcodes
- **66 containers** — Spool specifications and dimensions

*Note: These values are generated by the* `scripts/update_stats.py` *script.*

All data follows the [OpenPrintTag Architecture](https://arch.openprinttag.org) schema and can be imported into any database or application.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Edit directly on GitHub (easiest)

1. Browse to the `data/` folder
2. Find the file you want to edit (e.g., `data/brands/prusament.yaml`)
3. Click the pencil icon ✏️ to edit
4. Make your changes and submit a Pull Request

→ See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed step-by-step guides.

### Option B: Use the UI Editor (recommended for larger changes)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OpenPrintTag/openprinttag-database.git
cd openprinttag-database

# Start the editor (auto-installs dependencies)
make editor
```

The command checks for Node.js 18+, installs pnpm if needed, and opens the editor at http://localhost:3000.

→ See [ui-editor/README.md](ui-editor/README.md) for more details.

### Option C: Edit YAML files directly

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/OpenPrintTag/openprinttag-database.git
cd openprinttag-database
make setup

# Validate your changes
make validate
```

```

### Brands

Manufacturers and suppliers of materials.

See example: [`data/brands/prusament.yaml`](data/brands/prusament.yaml)

### Materials

Individual materials with detailed properties.

See example: [`data/materials/prusament/prusament-asa-jet-black.yaml`](data/materials/prusament/prusament-asa-jet-black.yaml)

### Material Packages

Physical products you can buy — spools with barcodes.

See example: [`data/material-packages/prusament/prusament-pla-prusa-orange-1000-spool.yaml`](data/material-packages/prusament/prusament-pla-prusa-orange-1000-spool.yaml)

### Material Containers

Spool and container specifications.

See example: [`data/material-containers/1000g.yaml`](data/material-containers/1000g.yaml)

---

## File Naming Convention

All files use **slugified names**:
- Lowercase letters
- Words separated by hyphens
- No special characters

Example: `prusament-pla-galaxy-black.yaml`

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether you want to:

- **Add a new brand** — Know a manufacturer not in the database?
- **Add materials** — Have specifications for materials we're missing?
- **Fix errors** — Spotted a typo or wrong value?
- **Add photos** — Have product images? You can upload them directly in the UI editor

**→ Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for detailed step-by-step guides on:

- How to add a new brand
- How to add a new material
- How to edit existing data
- How to submit your changes as a Pull Request

## Schema & Validation

This database follows the [OpenPrintTag Architecture](https://github.com/OpenPrintTag/openprinttag-architecture) schema. The specific version is configured in `schema_version.conf`.

**Schema ensures:**
- Field types are correct
- Required fields are present
- UUIDs are properly formatted and derived according to the [UUID specification](https://arch.openprinttag.org/#/uuid)
- References (brand_slug, material_slug) are valid
- Enum values match allowed options
- GTINs and URLs follow correct patterns

### UUID Derivation

UUIDs in this database are derived using UUIDv5 (SHA1 hash) according to the [OpenPrintTag Architecture UUID specification](https://arch.openprinttag.org/#/uuid):

- **Brand UUID**: Derived from brand name
- **Material UUID**: Derived from brand UUID + material name
- **Package UUID**: Derived from brand UUID + GTIN

When creating new entries, you can leave the `uuid` field empty or omit it entirely - it will be automatically derived during validation.
